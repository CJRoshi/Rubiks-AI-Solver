# **Welcome to RubiksNet!**

RubiksNet is a small project from the North Andover High School Engineering Club that uses Deep Learning (in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network) to try to solve a Rubik's Cube from *your* image input.

The project is **not released yet**, but it will be soon.

The first release will feature a simple GUI by which you can test our NN's performance (It's not too great...), get solutions to a Rubik's Cube after correcting it, and __optionally__ upload your photos to us so we can have more data to work with.

__See you soon!__
